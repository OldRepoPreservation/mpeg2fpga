These are configuration files for the Logicport logic analyzer. 
The adapter from http://www.kdvelectronics.eu/probe_adapter/probe_adapter.html has been used as interface between Xilinx ml505 board and Logicport logic analyzer.

To use, set testpoint_sel either 
- using a write to to the testpoint register 
- or using dip switches.

Note configuration files can be read and waveforms displayed by Logicport software even if no analyzer is present. 
The Logicport software can be downloaded from http://www.pctestinstruments.com at no charge.
