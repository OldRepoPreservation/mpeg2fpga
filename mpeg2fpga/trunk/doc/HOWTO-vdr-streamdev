vdr [1] is a digital video recorder program, optionally extended with plugins.
The streamdev [2] plugin allows vdr to stream video over the LAN. 
This document describes briefly how to configure vdr with streamdev to 
stream live TV to the ML505.

Assume the ML505 has been assigned ip address 192.168.153.9, 
and the vdr system uses ip address 192.168.153.3.
Start up the Xilinx ML505 with the mpeg2fpga bitstream.

On the vdr system, set up the arp entry for the ML505:

pandora ~ # arp -s 192.168.153.9 01:02:03:04:05:06

Using the remote control, enable the vdr-to-vdr server in streamdev,
using the default port 2004.

Next, telnet to the streamdev port:

koen@macpro ~ $ telnet 192.168.153.3 2004
Trying 192.168.153.3...
Connected to 192.168.153.3.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 Welcome to Video Disk Recorder (VTP)
CAPS PES
220 Capability "PES" accepted
PORT 0 192,168,153,9,64,1
220 Port command ok, data connection opened
TUNE 1
220 Channel tuned
QUIT
221 Video Disk Recorder closing connection
Connection closed by foreign host.
koen@macpro ~ $

streamdev commands explained:
"CAPS PES": ask for a packetized elementary stream to be sent
"PORT 0 192,168,153,9,64,1": send the PES stream to IP address 192.168.153.9, port 16385 (=64*256+1)
"TUNE 1": Tune to first channel in channel list
A PES stream is sent to the ML505, and video is decoded.
If need be, modeline parameters can be modified "on the fly" using mpeg2ether.
"QUIT": Ends video streaming
