This directory contains graphs.
With the exception of mpeg2fpga, which was drawn by hand, all graphs have been generated from the Verilog sources using the "mkfsmgraph" script.
The graph layout was done using uDrawGraph from the University of Bremen, Germany.

Flow:
 Verilog source -> mkfsmgraph -> gml2udg -> uDrawGraph -> print postscript -> pdf
